# ontology

This is a conceptual set of Java types, awaiting Borges' reincarnation as a software developer to find their applications.

## The Types

```java
/**
 * An object will catch any {@link UnsupportedOperationException} and instead
 * return {@code true}.
 */
public interface Agreeable {
}
```

```java
/**
 * A class that implements Dishonorable is able to bypass all Java visibilty
 * modifiers, but it may only be extended or instantiated by other objects
 * that implement Dishonorable.
 */
public interface Dishonorable {
}
```

```java
/**
 * This exception is used to indicate a violation of a logic principle, the
 * presence of cognitive bias, or simply the fundamental inability for human
 * sensory perception to apprehend the true nature of reality.
 */
public class EpistemologyException extends Exception {
}
```

```java
/**
 * When calling a method on an object that implements Inscrutable, a random
 * method on the same object will be invoked in its place.
 */
public interface Inscrutable {
}
```


```java
/**
 * Any object allocated by an object implementing Memorious can never be
 * garbage collected.
 */
public interface Memorious {
}
```

```java
/**
 * Attempts to use the Java Reflection API on objects that implement Obtuse
 * will always receive unhelpful--but technically true--type signatures.
 */
public interface Obtuse {
}
```


```java
/**
 * Any attempt to use the Java Reflection API on an object implementing
 * Unknowable will throw an {@link EpistemologyException}.
 */
public interface Unknowable {
}
```


```java
/**
 * An object that implements Venerable is allocated directly into the old generation.
 */
public interface Venerable {
}
```
